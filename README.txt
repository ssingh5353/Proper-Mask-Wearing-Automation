In order to be able to run the Jupyter Notebook completely, please complete the following:

Install Anaconda - 
1. Visit https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
2. Click on the "Download" button
3. Run the downloaded file and use all default settings with installation

Once you have the software downloaded, please download the repository locally. You can now launch the file.

To launch the file -
1. Use terminal to navigate to the directory with the file Proper_Mask_Wearing_Detection_Automation.ipynb
2. In terminal, type the command 'jupyter notebook' (this will launch Jupyter in your web browser)
3. Open the file Proper_Mask_Wearing_Detection_Automation.ipynb
4. Click the "Kernel" tab
5. Click "Restart & Run All"

Please allow significant time for the program to run. When running on a machine with a 2.7 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 processor and 16 GB of RAM, it took ~1 hour. You can watch your favorite TV show while the model trains and come back after a couple episodes to see the results! :)
