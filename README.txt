In order to be able to run the Jupyter Notebook completely, please complete the following:

Issues may arise if your python version is >= 3.9. If this is the case, you may need to downgrade to <= 3.8.x

Install Anaconda - 
1. Visit https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
2. Click on the "Download" button
3. Run the downloaded file and use all default settings with installation

Install cv2 -
1. Open terminal
2. Run the command "conda install -c menpo opencv"

Install tensorflow -
1. Open terminal
2. Run the command "pip install tensorflow"

Once you have the software downloaded, please download the repository locally. You can now launch the file.

To launch the file -
1. Use terminal to navigate to the directory with the file Proper_Mask_Wearing_Detection_Automation.ipynb
2. In terminal, type the command 'jupyter notebook' (this will launch Jupyter in your web browser)
3. Open the file Proper_Mask_Wearing_Detection_Automation.ipynb
4. Click the "Kernel" tab
5. Click "Restart & Run All"

Please allow significant time for the program to run. When running on a machine with a 2.7 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 processor and 16 GB of RAM, it took ~1 hour. You can watch your favorite TV show while the model trains and come back after a couple episodes to see the results! :)
